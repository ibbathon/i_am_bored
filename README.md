# i_am_bored
A central repository for any random projects I spin up. Most won't be more than a hundred lines of code and intended purely for fun. Especially interesting projects will be moved to their own repositories.

## Commit messages and cooperation
None of the commit messages for this repository will be detailed, as this is just a place for me to futz around with small projects that don't deserve their own repositories. Additionally, I will not be allowing pull requests/collaboration, as any projects large enough to require such would invalidate their status in being here.
